Select the Best Predictive Model in ERA
====================================================
**Out-of-sample error estimation for model selection in ERA**

This repository contains entire R code work and datafiles used for all the analyses, tables, and figures in the manuscript "Prediction-Oriented Model Selection Metrics for Extended Redundancy Analysis." All of the original data used for the creation of [merged2016-2019.csv](https://github.com/QuantMM/PredictiveERAmodeling/blob/main/merged2016-2019.csv) were downloaded from: [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-nid13517). Specifically, NSDUH data collected during the more recent years, 2016-2019, were used (see the references below).
